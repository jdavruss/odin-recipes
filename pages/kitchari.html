        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Basmati Rice</li>
                <li>Split Mung Beans</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Spice</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cumin Seed</li>
                    <li>Fresh Ground Ginger</li>
                    <li>Ground Tumeric</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Pepper</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Ghee or Oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak rice and beans in a medium bowl, combine the rice and beans. Pour enough water to cover the mixture and soak for 15-20 minutes. Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain and rinse the mixture until the water runs clear.</li>

                <li>Add oil to a medium pot on medium-low heat. Once the oil starts to warm up, carefully add the cumin seeds and cook until the seeds start to brown and become fragrant, which takes about 1 minute. Add the ginger and ground tumeric.</li>

                <li>Add the rice and moong dal mixture. Pour water, season with salt and pepper, and stir.</li>

                <li>Increase the heat to medium-high to bring the mixture to a slight boil. Immediately turn the heat down to medium-low to a gentle simmer. Cook uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally until you get a porridge-like consistency. It should be soft and creamy.</li>

                <li>Adjust the seasoning, if needed, and taste to make sure the mixture is cooked through. If not, cook for longer. Feel free to add a few tablespoons of water if it starts to get very thick.</li>

                <li>Serve immediately or cool down and store for later.</li>
            </ol>
